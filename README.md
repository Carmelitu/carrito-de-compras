Project made for a JavaScript course on Udemy. The code is in Spanish and its purpose is to operate a shopping cart. I just did the script. HTML and CSS are delivered already finalized by the teacher.

The site simulates a courses page where courses can be added to the cart. Courses can be removed individually or the cart can be emptied completely. Also your changes are saved because the site uses LocalStorage.
